# NAPH — Computation-Ready Digitisation Standard for Aerial Photography Heritage

A focused, vertical, openly-licensed digitisation standard for **aerial photography heritage collections**. Provides ontology, validation shapes, transformation pipeline, IIIF bridge, governance model, and full deliverables — the complete A-to-Z system designed for institutions like NCAP, IWM, NARA-partnered archives, and equivalent national aerial photography holdings worldwide.

Aligned with the goals of the **Towards a National Collection** programme (AHRC / UKRI) and the **N-RICH Prototype**. See [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md).

> **Now backed by real NCAP data**
>
> This case study no longer runs on synthetic records alone. It ingests a live,
> reproducible sample of **292 real frames** harvested from NCAP's public
> [Air Photo Finder API](https://airphotofinder.ncap.org/), reprojected from
> EPSG:3857 to WGS84 and auto-lifted to the NAPH Baseline tier — **0 SHACL
> violations**. Testing the standard against real holdings found (and fixed) a
> real defect in the standard's own date-precision shape.
>
> - **What the live API actually exposes:** [`docs/empirical-api-findings.md`](docs/empirical-api-findings.md) — 100% of records already carry a machine-readable footprint and an ISO-8601 date. NCAP is closer to Baseline than the browser suggests.
> - **Harvester:** [`pipeline/scrapers/ncap_airphotofinder.py`](pipeline/scrapers/ncap_airphotofinder.py) (respectful, rate-limited, metadata only)
> - **Real data:** [`data/real-ncap-sample.ttl`](data/real-ncap-sample.ttl) · **Live map:** [`demo/real.html`](demo/real.html) · **STAC + GeoJSON exports:** [`reports/`](reports/)

## Why narrow

Generic GLAM-wide digitisation standards exist. Aerial photography heritage has distinctive characteristics — stereo pairs, ground sample distance, declassification provenance, sortie metadata — that benefit from a focused, deep treatment rather than a generic framework. NAPH is deliberately one vertical, done well. See [ADR-0001](deliverables/06-knowledge-transfer/architecture-decision-records/0001-narrow-vertical.md).

## Why this exists

The aerial photography heritage sector — NCAP, IWM, NARA, RAF Museum, RCAHMS, equivalent national institutions — holds collectively ~50 million records that are **digitised but not computable**. They sit on the web for human browsing but cannot be queried, aggregated, or analysed at scale by modern research tools.

NAPH is a focused vertical standard that closes that gap for aerial photography specifically, rather than chasing a generic GLAM-wide framework that has to compromise on every domain. Aerial photography has rich spatial, temporal, and event-linked context that becomes far more powerful when modelled as linked data — and that depth deserves a dedicated treatment.

This case study shows what a **3-tier digitisation standard** looks like when applied to a real-shaped heritage dataset — and what the gap is between current archive-cataloguing practice (ISAD-G, free-text fields, image-on-the-web) and computation-readiness.

## The three tiers

|Tier|Scope|Required fields|
|---|---|---|
| **Baseline** | Minimum viable computation-readiness | Stable identifier, ISO 8601 date, geographic footprint (WGS84 polygon), machine-readable rights statement, sortie reference, collection link |
| **Enhanced** | Supports research workflows | Baseline + digitisation provenance (date, resolution, format, operator), capture context (altitude, camera, squadron, aircraft), full provenance chain, multiple surrogate formats |
| **Aspirational** | Supports semantic discovery | Enhanced + subject classification, place authority links (GeoNames / Wikidata), cross-collection linked records, event linkage |

Each tier is **incrementally adoptable** — a collection at Baseline does not need to rebuild to reach Enhanced.

cd case-studies/heritage-aerial
python3 -m http.server 8765

# Open the demo
# http://localhost:8765/demo/index.html
```

The demo loads the IIIF collection manifest and renders the 10 records on an interactive map — tier-coloured markers, WGS84 footprint polygons, click-through metadata panel. The user-facing artefact that makes the standard concrete.

## The sample dataset

Ten illustrative photograph records distributed across the three tiers:

|#|Tier|Sortie|Subject|Date|
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Baseline | RAF/106G/UK/1655 | Berlin reconnaissance | 1944-03-28 |
| 2 | Baseline | CPE/SCOT/UK/216 | Edinburgh city centre | 1947-06-15 |
| 3 | Baseline | USN/VD-1/PAC | Saipan coastline | 1944-08-12 |
| 4 | Enhanced | RAF/541/HAM | Hamburg post-firestorm | 1943-07-30 |
| 5 | Enhanced | RAF/58/ABDN | Aberdeen harbour | 1948-09-22 |
| 6 | Enhanced | USAF/91SRS/KOR | Pyongyang industrial district | 1951-04-18 |
| 7 | Enhanced | DOS/KEN | Mount Kenya foothills | 1954-11-08 |
| 8 | Aspirational | RAF/540/PEEN | Peenemünde V-2 facility | 1943-06-23 |
| 9 | Aspirational | RAF/541/EDI | Edinburgh Castle | 1946-08-04 |
| 10 | Aspirational | USAAF/3PRS/HIR | Hiroshima post-detonation | 1945-08-11 |

**Note on the dataset:** these records are *modeled on the structure* of NCAP holdings — they use plausible sortie identifier formats, real squadron/aircraft pairings, real geographic coordinates, and rights statements aligned with rightsstatements.org. They are illustrative of what NCAP records *could look like* under the proposed standard, not assertions that these specific frames exist in the NCAP catalogue with these exact identifiers.

## What this demonstrates

**1. The cost of going from Baseline to Enhanced is small.** Most of the data already exists in NCAP — sortie metadata, squadron, aircraft, capture conditions are routinely recorded. The gap is structuring it (ISO dates, machine-readable fields, explicit provenance chains) rather than acquiring new information.

**2. The cost of going from Enhanced to Aspirational is significant — but partly automatable.** Subject classification, place authority linking, cross-collection record matching can be partially performed by vision-language models and entity-linking tools. The standard should specify *outcome requirements* (what needs to be linked, to which authorities) rather than prescribing manual workflows.

**3. The same standard works across collection sub-types.** RAF reconnaissance, US-transferred imagery, post-war urban surveys, and overseas surveys all model cleanly into the same ontology. The differences are in which optional fields apply, not in the core structure.

**4. Computation-ready is achievable with no new research.** The ontology is built from existing standards (PROV-O, GeoSPARQL, SKOS, Dublin Core, DCAT, FOAF) — synthesis, not invention.

## How to use it

### With Open Ontologies CLI

```bash
# Validate
open-ontologies validate ontology/naph-core.ttl

# Load and query
open-ontologies serve &
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/load -d '{"path":"case-studies/heritage-aerial/ontology/naph-core.ttl"}'
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/load -d '{"path":"case-studies/heritage-aerial/data/sample-photographs.ttl"}'

# Run SHACL validation against the tiered shapes
open-ontologies shacl --shapes ontology/naph-shapes.ttl --data data/sample-photographs.ttl
```

### With Open Ontologies Studio

Open the Studio app, load `naph-core.ttl` followed by `sample-photographs.ttl`. The 3D graph view will render the class hierarchy and individual records. Use the agent chat to run validation, reasoning, or natural-language queries.

## Example queries (computational research that current NCAP metadata can't answer cleanly)

```sparql
# All photographs covering Edinburgh between 1945 and 1950
PREFIX naph: <https://w3id.org/naph/ontology#>
PREFIX geo: <http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#>
SELECT ?photo ?date WHERE {
  ?photo a naph:AerialPhotograph ;
         naph:capturedOn ?date ;
         naph:coversArea/naph:asWKT ?wkt .
  FILTER (?date >= "1945-01-01"^^xsd:date && ?date <= "1950-12-31"^^xsd:date)
  FILTER (geof:sfIntersects(?wkt, "POLYGON((-3.21 55.94, -3.16 55.94, -3.16 55.97, -3.21 55.97, -3.21 55.94))"^^geo:wktLiteral))
}

# All photographs depicting historic events with Wikidata links
SELECT ?photo ?event ?wikidata WHERE {
  ?photo a naph:AerialPhotograph ;
         naph:depicts ?event .
  ?event a naph:HistoricEvent ;
         skos:exactMatch ?wikidata .
}

# Compliance-tier distribution across the collection
SELECT ?tier (COUNT(?photo) AS ?count) WHERE {
  ?photo naph:compliesWithTier ?tier .
} GROUP BY ?tier
```

## End-to-end demonstration: legacy CSV → computation-ready

The most important piece of this case study is showing what the lift actually costs.

`pipeline/legacy-ncap-style.csv` contains 10 records in the form a real heritage cataloguer might receive: free-text dates in 8 different formats, free-text rights statements, point coordinates, altitudes in feet, mixed punctuation. This is what "digitised but not computable" looks like.

```bash
# One command: messy CSV → valid NAPH Turtle at Baseline tier
python3 pipeline/ingest.py pipeline/legacy-ncap-style.csv > pipeline/generated-from-csv.ttl

# Verify the output validates against the standard
open-ontologies validate pipeline/generated-from-csv.ttl
# → {"ok":true,"triples":263}

# Verify it conforms to the SHACL shapes
echo "clear
load ontology/naph-core.ttl
load pipeline/generated-from-csv.ttl
shacl ontology/naph-shapes.ttl" | open-ontologies batch
# → conforms: true, violations: 0
```

The pipeline performs the exact transformations the standard requires:

|Transformation|Input|Output|
|---|---|---|
| Date normalisation | `28 March 1944`, `15-Jun-1947`, `30/07/1943`, `23-Jun-43` | `1944-03-28`, `1947-06-15`, `1943-07-30`, `1943-06-23` |
| Rights mapping | `Crown Copyright Expired` | `https://rightsstatements.org/page/NoC-OKLR/1.0/` |
| Geometry construction | `lat=55.949, lon=-3.195` | WGS84 polygon footprint |
| Unit conversion | `30000` (feet) | `9144.0` (metres) |
| Identifier minting | `RAF/106G/UK/1655` + frame `4023` | `https://w3id.org/naph/photo/RAF-106G-UK-1655-4023` |

This is what an institution actually pays for when adopting the standard — and `ingest.py` is 200 lines.

## Generating validation reports

```bash
python3 pipeline/generate-report.py > reports/validation-report.html
```

Runs the full validation suite (load → SHACL → all competency queries) and emits a styled HTML report with live results. Designed as the artefact institutions publish alongside their data to demonstrate compliance — the dashboard view of NAPH adoption.

## IIIF interoperability

```bash
# One photo
python3 pipeline/iiif-bridge.py "https://w3id.org/naph/example/photo-009" > manifest.json

# Whole collection
python3 pipeline/iiif-bridge.py --all > reports/iiif-collection-manifest.json
```

NAPH-compliant records emit valid **IIIF Presentation API 3.0** Manifests, which means any IIIF viewer (Mirador, Universe Viewer) and any IIIF-aware computational tool can consume the collection without bespoke integration. NAPH metadata flows into IIIF `metadata` pairs; rights statements populate the IIIF `rights` field; the RDF representation is linked via `seeAlso`.

This is interoperability without lock-in: institutions adopt NAPH and gain the IIIF ecosystem for free.

## Roadmap

This is **v0.3** — working ontology, validated SHACL shapes, end-to-end ingest pipeline, IIIF bridge, validation reports, **and a live real-data harvest** from the NCAP Air Photo Finder API.

- [x] **v0.3** — real Air Photo Finder data (292 frames, live API, reprojected + validated); date-precision shape fix; STAC + GeoJSON exports; RiC-O × STAC crosswalk
- [ ] **v0.4** — automated subject classification pipeline (vision-language models, drafts requiring human validation)
- [ ] **v0.5** — full case study writeup with cost/effort breakdown per tier and partner adoption playbook

## Why publish this as open source

This case study is published openly because:

- **Heritage collections need this work** — the problem is real and the gap is sector-wide.
- **Standards adopt faster when they have working reference implementations alongside specification documents.**
- **Open Ontologies is a general-purpose tool** — heritage / GLAM is one application domain among many, and a real-world case study makes the tool more useful to other domains too.
