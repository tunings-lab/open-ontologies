# Open Ontologies Lite (Python bridge)

A lightweight, pip-installable Python bridge to the same [Oxigraph](https://github.com/oxigraph/oxigraph) RDF/OWL engine that powers [Open Ontologies](https://github.com/fabio-rovai/open-ontologies). **No Rust toolchain, no compilation, no multi-gigabyte build directory** — `pyoxigraph` ships the engine as a prebuilt wheel, so everything here is pure-Python glue installed from PyPI.

It exposes the core ontology lifecycle as both a Python library and an MCP server.

## Why this exists

The full Rust engine compiles a large dependency tree from source (5+ GB of build artifacts, heavy SSD churn). This bridge is the opposite trade: install in seconds, run anywhere Python runs, keep the Oxigraph SPARQL engine underneath. It covers the core surface (validate, load, query, diff, lint, convert, stats, save), not the full 100-tool engine.

## Install

```bash
pip install open-ontologies-lite        # one universal wheel, no compiler
```

## Use as a Python library

```python
from open_ontologies_lite import OntologyEngine

engine = OntologyEngine()
engine.load(open("ontology.ttl").read())          # load Turtle
print(engine.stats())                              # {'triples':..,'classes':..,..}

rows = engine.query(
    "SELECT ?c WHERE { ?c a <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#Class> }"
)
print([r["c"] for r in rows["rows"]])

print(engine.lint())                               # missing labels/domains/ranges
print(OntologyEngine.convert(ttl, "turtle", "ntriples"))
```

See [examples/python_usage.py](examples/python_usage.py) for a runnable end-to-end script.

## Use as an MCP server

```bash
open-ontologies-lite          # stdio MCP server
# or: python -m open_ontologies_lite
```

Register it with any MCP client (e.g. Claude):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "open-ontologies-lite": { "command": "open-ontologies-lite" }
  }
}
```

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `onto_validate` | Parse RDF/OWL and report syntax validity + triple count (no load) |
| `onto_load` / `onto_load_file` | Load RDF text or a file into the in-memory store |
| `onto_clear` | Reset the store |
| `onto_stats` | Triple / class / property / individual counts |
| `onto_query` | SPARQL SELECT / ASK / CONSTRUCT / DESCRIBE |
| `onto_save` | Serialize the store to a file |
| `onto_convert` | Convert between Turtle / N-Triples / N-Quads / TriG / RDF-XML / N3 / JSON-LD |
| `onto_diff` | Triple-level diff between two ontologies |
| `onto_lint` | Missing labels, domains, ranges |

## Relationship to the Rust engine

This is the **Python layer** of the project. For the full engine (three-layer Dynamics/Causal/Planner architecture, HNSW semantic search, OWL2-DL tableaux reasoning, PDDL planning, governance, 100 tools), use the [Rust build](https://github.com/fabio-rovai/open-ontologies). Same Oxigraph core; pick the weight class you need.
